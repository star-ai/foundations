# OpenAI Gym
### Installation
Follow https://github.com/openai/gym

need to install Box2D specifically for Box2D envs.

# Notes
custom_agent.py is a copy from pysc2, modifying this file and running it 
directly is more convenient compared to running pysc2.bin.agent
with different arguments passed through

Leaving it here for now to see if people wants to use it
